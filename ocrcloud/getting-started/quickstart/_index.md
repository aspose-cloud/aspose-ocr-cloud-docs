## **Create an account**
For details on how to create a new account please check [Create a new Account](https://docs.aspose.cloud/display/storagecloud/Creating+and+Managing+Account).
## **Create an API Client App**
Before you can make any requests to Aspose Cloud APIs you need to [create an API Client App](https://docs.aspose.cloud/display/storagecloud/Create+New+App+and+Get+App+Key+and+SID).

This will give you **App SID** and **App key (secret key)** which you can use to invoke Aspose Cloud APIs.
## **Install the SDK of your choice**
Using an SDK (API client) is the quickest way for a developer to speed up the development. An SDK takes care of a lot of low-level details of making requests and handling responses and lets you focus on writing code specific to your particular project. Please check [Available SDKs](/available-sdks/) article to learn how to add an SDK to your project.
## **Make an API request from the SDK of your choice**
Use the **App SID** and **App key (secret key)** from the API app client you created in step one and replace in the corresponding code. The following example demonstrates how to extract OCR or HOCR Text from images.

The GitHub repository for Aspose.OCR Cloud has a complete set of examples, demonstrating our API capabilities.
